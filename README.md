# Brain-Signals-Computing-for-Human-Computer-Interaction

The purpose of this study was to determine if a Virtual Reality (VR) system combined with brain signaling can produce biometric authentication in a usable form. This was a team project. My team and I collected VR (Virtual Reality) and non-VR data using Ultracortex EEG Mark IV headset. We used MNE python library to eradicate noise and made them cleaned. You can see code for that. 

### For Future Work

We can analyze VR and non-VR signals in analysis. 
We can compare the analysis with other available datasets
The VR analysis could be applied to brain-based biometric authentication
Participant health concerns could be identified during EEG scans
