# Brain-Signals-Computing-for-Human-Computer-Interaction

The purpose of this study is to determine if a Virtual Reality (VR) system combined with brain signaling can produce biometric authentication in a usable form. This is a team project. My team and I collected VR (Virtual Reality) and non-VR data using Ultracortex EEG Mark IV headset. We used MNE python library to eradicate noise and made them cleaned. You can see the code for that. 
 

### For Future Work

Feature extraction of VR and nonVR EEG will be done and distance computation will be performed to determine subject authenticity. A demonstration will be implemented to showcase this technology for use in EEG based biometric authentication.
